BackToPure is a web-based interface designed to streamline and automate the management of research data within the PURE system. This platform provides a simple and intuitive way to execute a series of predefined scripts that handle various aspects of data enrichment and importation from external sources like RicGraph. The goal is to ensure that the data in PURE is comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurately reflects the academic contributions and research outputs of the institution.

On this site, you can run different scripts tailored to specific tasks, ranging from enriching internal and external person data to importing datasets and research outputs. Each script is designed to handle complex tasks behind the scenes, presenting you with only the necessary options and output information.
